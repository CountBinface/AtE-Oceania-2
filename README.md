# AtE-Oceania
After the End Oceania, a post-apocalyptic Oceania mod for Crusader Kings II

The ateo folder and ateo.mod file are the files that have to be put in the mod folder for Crusader Kings II in order for the mod to run. 
The map resources folder has the various stages for different types of maps I use in the map making process on gimp, all extracted from QGIS.
In the future I will be adding folders for lore, as well as general outlines for religions, different realms, and various other ideas I have not yet implemented.
If you are trying to run the mod, turn off Legacy of Rome before you start it. If you don't, the mod will crash within the first month or so of playtime.
